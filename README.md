I like to play some small games and came across a game called HANGMAN 

The rules are simple

1. Hit start to play.
2. A random word will be assign to you to guess along with some hint.
3. The number of tries are limited to 5.
4. At a time you can only enter 1 character.
5. If you guess the word correctly then will be directed to next level.
6. There are total of 5 level.
7. One has to pass all the 5 levels to win.
